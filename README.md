# IA2
Works for IA2 class with Perceptron, Adaline, Back-propagation implementations

## Comenzando 🚀

## Important NOTE ‼
All these implementations use graphical interfaces with Tkinker and python3, 
needs for a python interpreter that had attached a DISPLAY (WSL can't be used).

### Pre-requirements 📋
- ``python3``
- ``pip3``

or a python interpreter with the builded libraries

maybe anaconda will work (no idea if had ``pypubsub`` and ``tkinter``)

***
## Usage

In every project (Folder), will contain a requirements.txt file with the needed
dependencies:

For python3

`` pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
you need to place into the path that contains the file (no idea why github send it to other directory that the main project)
``` pip3 install -r ./perceptron/requirements.txt ```
Or installed on the proper python interpreter

# Build in 🛠️
***

- [``python3``](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - lenguaje use for the code in general 
- [``numpy``](https://numpy.org/) - Library dedicated for math operations mainly for matrix operations, with grat speed
- [``matplotlib``](https://matplotlib.org/) - Library for ploting and canvas
- [``pypubsub``](https://pypubsub.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.3/) - Library for conect with a publisher/subscriber pattern the view and the model
- [``tkinter``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - Library for the UI disign 
- [``pip3``](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) - As the dependency manager
